# Quake - GOG - Arcane Dimensions - Darplaces - Wine
### Description:
Play "Quake" with "Arcane Dimensions mod" on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- Using Darkplaces engine
-  Arcane Dimensions mod: each map, or 'dimension', teleports the player to a very different area, with a very different vibe and overall 'feel'. Some dimensions are scifi, some ethereal, some dark and gothic. All are good. Tons of new enemies abound, ranging from variations on old favorites to new originals
