# Heart of Darkness CD + dgVoodoo2

### Description:
This script will facilitate install of this game on Linux OS:
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" CD edition using Lutris Wine runner and dgVoodoo2 http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/dgVoodoo2.html
During install please let all options by default.
Big thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions on Linux.


### Technical notes:
- You will need CD only during install
- HP2COS has insufficient controller support. You will find an Antimicrox profile for a x360 controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder
- Known issue: the mouse can get out of hand with most versions of WIne. Reason why this script will install and use Wine version 4.21
- Please report issue concerning this script on my github page:
