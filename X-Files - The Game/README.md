# X-Files - The Game - CD
### Description:
This Lutris script installer will install "The X-Files Game" 7 CD edition
### Technical notes:
- You will need install CDs only one time during install.
- This game is capricious, it does not run with all wine version. I obtained good results with Wine 8.0 vanilla, 8.1-staging. 
- This game will launch in a window 640x480. During my tests, the only solution to play this game in fullscreen is to use gamescope.
