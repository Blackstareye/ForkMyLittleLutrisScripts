### Technical notes:
- This game will launch in a window 640x480. During my tests, the only solution to play this game in fullscreen is to use gamescope.

# Bad Mojo Redux - CD
### Description:
"Bad Mojo Redux" CD edition
### Technical notes:
- This game is a 16 bit Windows game and it does not work (for the moment) with Wine. But it works very well on Windows 3.1x. So you will need to provide Windows 3.1x CD during install
- You will need to provide "Jewels of the Oracle" and "Windows 3.1" CD only one time during install
