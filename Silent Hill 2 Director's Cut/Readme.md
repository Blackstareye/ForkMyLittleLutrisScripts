# Silent Hill 2 DC - SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs

### Description:
This installer is complementary to "CD Director's Cut EU + SH2e" one, it will add SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs to previous install from SH2e project http://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2
Big thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions on Linux, particularly Elisha Riedlinger and all SH2e devs team.

### Technical notes:
- This installer will not install "Silent Hill 2 Director's Cut EU" but only SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs. I separated the two installations because these two packs are too heavy: FMV --> 3,2 Go and audio --> 1,6 Go
