# Silent Hill 2 - Director's Cut EU - CD - SH2e

### Description:
This script will install "Silent Hill 2 - Director's Cut" 3 CD EU release with many fixes and enhancements to support recent computer configurations.
This script uses different projects: 
Sh2proxy: https://github.com/emoose/sh2proxy/releases
SH2e: http://www.enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/
Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions, particularly Elisha Riedlinger and all SH2e devs team.

### Technical notes:
- You will need the 3 CD only during install
- Multilanguage: you can choose language to display menus and subtitles during install between english, french, german, italian and spanish. 
- This game supports natively x360 controller.
- After installation, I invite you to click on "SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs" Lutris script installer and so complete enhanced Silent Hill 2 gaming experience.
- Known issue: When you start the game, you have to wait about 15 seconds before the game starts, time for DXVK to compile shaders.

# Silent Hill 2 DC - SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs

Description:
This installer is complementary to "CD Director's Cut EU + SH2e" one, it will add SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs to previous install.
It uses SH2e project:  
http://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/#installFMVPack
http://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/#installAudioEnhancementPack
Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions, particularly Elisha Riedlinger and all SH2e devs team.

Technical notes:
- This installer will not install "Silent Hill 2 Director's Cut EU" but only SH2e FMV-Audio remastered packs. I separated the two installations because these two packs are too heavy: FMV --> 3,2 Go and audio --> 1,6 Go.
