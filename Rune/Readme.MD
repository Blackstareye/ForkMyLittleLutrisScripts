# RUNE - CD - Linux 

Description:
This script will install "Rune" Linux CD edition.
Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- 1.08 HOV update
- Multiplayer OK
- Known issues:
  - Multiplayer, join button, miss the "j" of "join"
  - Multiplayer, join, tab news is empty
  - When joining servers, sometimes the game crashes and complains: "The file '..\Textures\Drgnkeep.utx' contains unrecognizable data free(): invalid pointer". Same result with Decap1.utx and Galleon.utx files.
  - If you obtain "maps mismatch" error message, just erase the maps then the game will automatically upload the right map.
  - Gamepad: Rune Classic has bad controller support. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like Antimicro or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
Please report issue concerning this script on my github page:
