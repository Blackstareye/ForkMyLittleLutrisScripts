### Technical notes:
This game is fully playable on Linux with this Lutris script, but read carefully:
- Known issues: 
-- Steam is not fully usable, but it's not important, it's just installed to launch the game. 
-- If you loose mouse cursor during game or when you sign in to your Rockstar Social Club account, just press "shift"+"tab" to launch Steam overlay and your mouse cursor will come back.
-- This game is very capricious and unstable, it supports only a specific Wine and  DXVK version, I advice you to not change the ones set by default by this script. For the same raison, save often your game party.
-- This game does not work in DirectX 9 mode with Wine, for the moment, only DirectX 11 mode.
-- You will need a good hardware config to play this game.
- x360 compatible
