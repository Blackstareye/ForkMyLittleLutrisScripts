### Description:

### Technical notes:
This game is fully playable on Linux with this Lutris script, but read carefully:
- Known issues: 
-- Steam is not fully usable, but it's not important, it's just installed to launch the game. 
-- If you loose mouse cursor during game or when you sign in to your Rockstar Social Club account, just press "shift"+"tab" to launch Steam overlay and your mouse cursor will come back.
-- This game needs a special DXVK configuration that is already installed and it is not compatible with global Lutris DXVK. So you have to let this option inactivated in game Wine runner tab  or the game will not launch.
-- If the game does not launch, try this Lutris Wine version: lutris-lanoire-4.5-x86_64.
-- Actually this game does not work in DirectX 9 mode with Wine, only in DirectX 11 mode.
-- You will need a good hardware config to play this game.
- x360 compatible
