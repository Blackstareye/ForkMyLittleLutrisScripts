# Beyond Good and Evil - Windows Steam Standalone
### Description:
"Beyond Good & Evil" provided by Steam with widescreen patch and audio fix
### Technical notes:
This game does not work correctly with Linux Steam + Steamplay.
So I wrote this script that uses Windows Steam + others tweaks.
- fixed access to SettingsApplication where you can change language.
- Audio sync fix (dsound.dll + DXVK framerate set to 60 fps).
- ENB Mod: widescreen with no border.
- Steam is not fully usable, but it's not important, it's just installed to launch the game.
