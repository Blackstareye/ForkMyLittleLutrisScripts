# Maniac Mansion - any PC official edition

### Description:
This script will facilitate install of this game on Linux OS:
"Maniac Manson" PC official edition for ScummVM.
During install please let all options by default.
Big thanks to people who gave their time to permit us playing this game in the best conditions on Linux.

### Technical notes:
- This script supports the two official "Maniac Mansion" PC editions: "classic" and "enhanced"
- The "Maniac Mansion Deluxe" version is not an official version, more recent and created by fans, it is not yet compatible with ScummVM and therefore neither with this script installer
- This script will ask you for this files : 00.LFL, 01.LFL, O2.LFL... You will find them in any "Maniac Mansion" PC official edition
