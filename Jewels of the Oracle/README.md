# Jewels of the Oracle - CD + Win3.1x
### Description:
"Jewels of the Oracle"  CD edition using DOSBox and WIn 3.1x
### Technical notes:
- This game is a 16 bit Windows game and it does not work (for the moment) with Wine. But it works very well on Windows 3.1x. So you will need to provide Windows 3.1x CD during install.
- You will need to provide "Jewels of the Oracle" and "Windows 3.1x" CD only one time during install.
