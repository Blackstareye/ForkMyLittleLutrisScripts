# Jewels of the Oracle - CD + Windows 3.1x

### Description:
This script will facilitate you install of this game on Linux OS:
"Jewels of the Oracle"  CD edition using DOSBox.
During install please let all options by default.
Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions on Linux platform.

### Technical notes:
- This game is a 16 bit Windows game and it does not work (for the moment) with Wine. But it works very well on Windows 3.1x. So you will need to provide Windows 3.1x CD during install
- You will need to provide "Jewels of the Oracle" and "Windows 3.1" CD only one time during install
