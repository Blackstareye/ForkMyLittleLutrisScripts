# 8-Bit Hordes - GOG
### Description:
Play "8-Bit Hordes" provided by GOG on Linux!
### Technical notes:
The GOG(Auto) script installer does not work on my computer, so I wrote my own script
- disable DXVK or the game will crash
- You can play multiplayer in local. To play multiplayer on Internet , you need to install this game in GOG GALAXY: https://lutris.net/games/gog-galaxy
