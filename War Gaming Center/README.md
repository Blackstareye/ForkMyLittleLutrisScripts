# Wargaming Game Center

### Description:
It's important to verify you installed latest driver for your graphic card, Vulkan API and other wine dependencies before installing Game Center:

### Technical notes:
- During install, some error message dialogbox will appear, just click on "close" button
- WGC needs Wine 5.21 or superior version with Esync support
- If your WoT client crash when starting directly from launcher, change wine version or you can even start directly WoT.exe instead (if you don't need to update the game)
