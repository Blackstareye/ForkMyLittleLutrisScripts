# Moto Racer 1 - GOG - dgVoodoo2
### Description:
Play "Moto Racer 1" provided by GOG on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- using dgVoodoo2 to bypass 16 bits color depth limitation and play fullscreen
- Multiplayer functional on LAN with Directplay TCP/IP. MR1 GOG version can only join party, not be host. During my tests only MR1 CD install with 3.22 patch can be host
- x360 gamepad natively supported
