### Technical notes:
- Using dgVoodoo2 to fix white lines and playing scaled cinematics
- Using Gamescope is mandatory with this game because it does not support alt+tab causing the game to crash
- If game crashes with this message: "An invalid floating point camera matrix was passed to the D3D driver", use Proton experimental
- Multilingual: You could choose your preferred game's language for menus and subtitles between English (default), French, Spanish, German, Italian and Russian
- IJET has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find AntiMicroX profile(s) here:
