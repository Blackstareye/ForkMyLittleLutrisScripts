# Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb - GOG
### Description:
"Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb" provided by Gog using DxWnd and videos remastered pack
### Technical notes:
- During install you will have to provide IJET videos 1280x960 remastered pack  available for download at https://www.moddb.com/mods/moviesloading-screens-fix-full-screen-1280x960/downloads/movies-loading-screens-fix-full-screen-1280x960
- Multilingual: You could choose your preferred game's language for menus and subtitles between english (default), french, spanish, german, italian and russian.
- IJET has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find profiles for x360 (Antimicro) and Steam Controller (sc-controller) in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
