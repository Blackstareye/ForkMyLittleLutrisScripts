# Enclave - GOG

Description:
This script will install "Enclave" Gog edition with support for modern computer configuration.
During install please let all options by default.
This script uses DxWnd: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/
Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- You have to install Enclave in Steam before to launch this installer script.
- Enclave has bad controller support. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like Antimicro or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
- Please report issue concerning this script on my Github page:
