# Enclave - GOG

Description:
This script will install "Enclave" Gog edition with support for modern computer configuration.
During install please let all options by default.
This script uses DxWnd: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/
Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- You have to download Enclave Windows setup file from GOG before to launch this installer script.
- Nota: The Linux version is a Windows version with an old Wine version no longer maintained. In this case they are advantages to use directly the Windows version, you could choose the Wine version and personalize others Wine options in Lutris interface.
- Enclave has bad controller support. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like Antimicro or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
