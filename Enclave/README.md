# Enclave - GOG - DxWrapper
### Description:
Play "Enclave" provided by GOG on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- You have to install Enclave in Steam before to launch this installer script
- Enclave has bad controller support. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like AntimicroX or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360
