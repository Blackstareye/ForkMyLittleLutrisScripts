# Enclave - GOG - DxWnd
### Description:
Play "Enclave" provided by GOG on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- This script is only compatible with Enclave Windows setup file provided by GOG. In fact the Linux version is a Windows version which uses an old Wine version no longer maintained. In this case they are advantages to use directly the Windows version, you could choose the Wine version and personalize others Wine options in Lutris interface
- Gamepad support is not satisfactory. I wrote Antimicrox profiles, you can download them here:

# Enclave - Steam data - Wine
### Description:
"Enclave" provided by Steam using DxWnd
### Technical notes:
- You have to install Enclave in Steam before to launch this installer script.
- Enclave has bad controller support. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like AntimicroX or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
