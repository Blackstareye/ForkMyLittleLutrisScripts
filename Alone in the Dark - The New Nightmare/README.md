# Alone in the Dark - The New Nightmare - GOG
### Description:
Play "Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare" provided by GOG on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- Cutscenes may not play correctly, like a black screen and you can hear audio, depending the version of Wine. During my tests I obtained good results with recent Steam Proton 8.x version  or GE-Proton 8.25 to 8.29
- Play this game in Gamescope to avoid unstability and cap framerate to 60 fps
- Controller support is very lacking. For a better gaming experience, I advise you to use a keymapper, you will find the AntimicroX profiles here:
