# Alone in the Dark - The New Nightmare - GOG
### Description:
Play "Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare" provided by GOG on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- using Wine GDI renderer, workaround for black cinematics
- Controller support is very lacking. For a better gaming experience, I advise you to use a keymapper, you will find the AntimicroX profiles here:
