Description:
This script will install "Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare" GOG edition with support for modern computer configuration. During install please let all options by default. This script uses DxWnd: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/ Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- AITD4 controller support is very insufficient. For a better gaming experience, you will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
