# Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - CD
### Description:
Play "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" CD edition on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- You will need CD only one time during install
- using dxwrapper open source project to render this game in widescreen fullscreen and 60 fps
- this game does not natively support controller. I wrote an Antimicrox profile for PS3 dualshock, you can download it here: https://github.com/legluondunet/MyLittleLutrisScripts/raw/master/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Prisoner%20of%20Azkaban/hppoa.gamecontroller.amgp
