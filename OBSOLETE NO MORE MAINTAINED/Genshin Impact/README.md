### Description:

### Technical notes:
- This script uses a patch that is not supported by MiHoYo, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- You will need root rights to install this patch as it will modify /etc/hosts system file.
- You will need to find, edit, and run the patch manually - outside of Lutris - after the game update has finished.
- PATCH IS NOT APPLIED BY DEFAULT. To apply or revert it, right-click on the game icon/banner and select "execute script" --> https://imgur.com/D4jDdPX
- This script installer needs xdelta3, xterm, zenity binaries.
- If the install freezes during download, kill the "launcher.exe" process. Then launch the game from Lutris and choose option 2 in the menu "Update Genshin Impact". Once downloading and installing are completed, close the game, patch the game, start the game and choose option 1 in the menu.
