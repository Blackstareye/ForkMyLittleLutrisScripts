### Technical notes:
- Warcraft III version 1.31.1.12173 Public Test Realm x86_64 - 6 june 2019. The game will be downloaded from official Blizzard servers and we don't know much time they will keep it available.
- The game will ask you a valid key at first launch. You only need a Reign of Chaos CD Key, as blizzard now gifts everybody The Frozen Throne.
- Directx 11 version: this game needs DXVK to launch. Verify you installed Vulkan libraries before to launch this installer script.
- Known issue: you can not play multiplayer games on Internet, only Local LAN network games will be available. If it's a problem prefer playing Reforged version instead.
