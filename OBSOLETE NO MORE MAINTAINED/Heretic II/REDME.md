# Heretic II - Linux CD + Widescreen patch
### Description:
"Heretic II" CD Linux edition
### Technical notes:
- "Heretic II" will be updated to 1.06c version.
- WS patch: the game will be patch during install to use your desktop native resolution.
- Multilanguage: you will be able to select others game language during install between french, german, spanish or italian.
- Changing resolution will crash H2.
- ALT-TAB inactive when gaming fullscreen.
- You have to keep the CD mounted during gaming if you want to hear soundtrack.
- H2 controller support is insufficient. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like AntimicroX or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
