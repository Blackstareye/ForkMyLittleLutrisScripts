# Tomb Raider II - GOG + dgVoodoo2 + TR2Main
### Description:
"Tomb Raider II"  provided by GOG using dgVoodoo2 and TR2Main
### Technical notes:
- This script uses TR2Main: for stability and features, like PS1 inventory animated background.
- Tomb Raider II Gold extension included.
- TR2 has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find profiles for x360 (Antimicro) and Steam Controller (sc-controller) in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
