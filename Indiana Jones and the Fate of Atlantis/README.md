Description:
This script will install "Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb" Gog edition with support for modern resolution.
During install please let all options by default.
This script uses different projects:

Thanks to the people who contributed to play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- IJET has insufficient controller support, I invite you to use a keymapper. You will find profiles for x360 (Antimicro) and Steam Controller (sc-controller) in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
