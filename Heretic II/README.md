-Knowns issues:
-- Heretic II will crash if you launch directly a new game (Wine Bug 40468 https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40468). Workaround: start the tutorial level first, escape to the main menu, start a new game. This bug only occurs if you launch a new game directly, not when you load or save a game.
-- Changing resolution will crash H2
- H2 controller support is insufficient. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like Antimicro or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the "gamepad profiles" folder.
