# Heretic II - Win CD h2_setup.exe + DxWnD + WS
### Description:
"Heretic II" Windows CD edition using DxWnd project
### Technical notes:
- This Lutris script installer is compatible ONLY with Windows CD containing "h2_setup.exe" file.
- Widescreen patch: the game will be patched during install to use your desktop native resolution.
- Multilanguage: you will be able to select  others game  language during install between french, german, spanish or italian.
- "Heretic II" will be updated to 1.07 version.
- You will need the H2 CD only one time during install.
- "Heretic II" will crash if you launch directly a new game (Wine Bug 40468 https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40468). Workaround: start the tutorial level first, escape to the main menu, start a new game. This bug only occurs if you launch a new game directly, not when you load or save a game.
- Changing resolution will crash H2
- H2 controller support is insufficient. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like AntimicroX or sc-controller. You will find profiles for x360 and Steam Controller in the game folder.
