# Heretic II - Windows CD setup.exe + DxWnd
### Description:
Play "Heretic II" Windows CD edition on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- ONLY compatible with "Heretic II" Windows CD containing "setup.exe" file
- You will need the H2 CD only one time during installation
- This script installer will automagically set the game to your desktop resolution with widescreen mode
- Multilingual: you will be able to choose your preferred language for menus, subtitles and voices during installation between English (default), French, German, Italian and Spanish
- Enhancement Pack v1.07 included
- Press "~" key to show console
- H2 will crash if you launch directly a new game (Read the Faq). Workaround: start the tutorial level first, escape to the main menu, start a new game. This bug only occurs if you launch a new game directly, not when you load or save a game
- Changing resolution or renderer will crash H2
- H2 controller support is insufficient. Instead I invite you to use a keymapper like AntimicroX, you will find profiles I wrote here:
