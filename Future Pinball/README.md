### Technical notes:
- Main controls:  left and right SHIFT key for flippers, 5=add coins, 1=start, ENTER=pull - Main controls:  left and right SHIFT key for flippers, 5=add coins, 1=start, ENTER=pull plunger, ESC=exit table, F5=launch table.
- FP supports natively x360 gamepad. But if like me you prefer use triggers as flippers, you will find x360 (Antimicro) and Steam controller (sc-controller) profiles in "gamepad profiles" folder.
- Known issue:
-- Not BAM tables compatible
-- If your keyboard does not respond enough fast, use lutris-4.21-x86_64 version which fixes keyboard latency.
