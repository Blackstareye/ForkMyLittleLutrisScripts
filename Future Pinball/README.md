Back to the Future Ultimate 3.0 mod by francisco666, Glxb, Nitronimbus, rom, skinooe, SLAMT1LT, szaand: http://www.pinsimdb.org/fr/flipper/table-24475-back_to_the_future_ultimate_3_0_mod.
Thanks to the people who helped us play this game in the best conditions.

Technical notes:
- Main controls:  left and right SHIFT key for flippers, 5=add coins, 1=start, ENTER=pull plunger, ESC=exit table, F5=launch table.
- FP supports natively x360 gamepad. But if like me you prefer use triggers as flippers, you will find x360 (Antimicro) and Steam controller (sc-controller) profiles in "gamepad profiles" folder.
- Known issue:
Not BAM tables compatible
