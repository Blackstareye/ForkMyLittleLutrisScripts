# Warcraft III - Reign of Chaos - CD
### Description:
Play "Warcraft III - Reign of Chaos" CD edition on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- Included latest 1.27b update and widescreen patch
- This script would be compatible with all "Warcraft III - ROC" PC CD version whatever the language is
- You will need the CD only one time during install
- Multiplayer online is no more functionnal, but you can still play local network games (LAN)
- Running with Wine, this game could be a little unstable, it's advised to save regularly your party
- This game have issues playing cinematics. During my tests, game can play cinematics if: DXVK off, game launched in window mode (-window) with opengl renderer (-opengl). Depending on the graphics card used, MESA Zink and Gamescope could help too
