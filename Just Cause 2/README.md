# Just Cause 2 - Windows Steam Standalone

### Description:
Play "Just Cause 2" provided by Steam on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- The game does not launch on Steam/Linux version, but launches normally on Steam/Windows version, so I wrote this script
- Steam is not fully usable, but it's not important, it's just installed to launch the game
- Game takes time to exit, about 1 mn, normally you will not need to force exit
